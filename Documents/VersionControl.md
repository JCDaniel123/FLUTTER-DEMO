# Source Code Version Control Tools

## Introduction
In software development, version control is crucial for tracking and managing changes to code. It allows developers to maintain the integrity of their codebase, keeps a comprehensive history of modifications, and facilitates seamless collaboration among team members. Version control systems are essential tools that help mitigate risks, reduce errors, and provide a clear path for project evolution.

## Version Control System Used
For this project, I have chosen Github as my Version Control System. Github is renowned for its robustness, flexibility, and distributed nature, allowing for efficient handling of projects of any size. I chose Github because of its friendly interface and ease of use, and that it also works with best with my schools resources

## Repository Setup
My repository is structured to have a easy access to my devcontainer that can be used to run flutter apps. It also contains a documents directory that has all of the documentation related to the contents of the repository. It contains thesource code and app dependecies for mt Flutter Demo app in the FlutterDemoApp directory. And it also contains a .github directory that contains the workflows for runnning my pipeline in the "main.yml" file.

## Common Commands and Usage
During our development workflow, we frequently use commands such as:

git commit -m "type: description" for committing changes with a descriptive message.
git merge feature_branch for integrating new features into the main branch.
git revert <commit_hash> for undoing changes and reverting to previous versions.( change this)

## Collaboration Features
Git facilitates collaboration through features like:

Pull Requests: Allowing team members to review proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch.
Code Reviews: Enabling a thorough examination of the code to maintain quality.
Conflict Resolution: Providing tools to resolve coding conflicts that arise from concurrent modifications. ( And look at this )

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge I faced with my version control  was ensuring that my version control was properly synced. Since when I started initally I commited changes directly from Github and also from Git, so the  environments were not fully in sync which caused issues with commiting changes.

## Conclusion
The use of Github will be extremely important for the success of this project. It has provided me with a robust framework for tracking changes, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring my development process is scalable and secure and organized. Integrating version control into my workflow will lead to more efficient development cycles and a stable codebase.
