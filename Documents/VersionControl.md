# Source Code Version Control Tools

## Introduction
In software development, version control is crucial for tracking and managing changes to code. It allows developers to maintain the integrity of their codebase, keeps a comprehensive history of modifications, and facilitates seamless collaboration among team members. Version control systems are essential tools that help mitigate risks, reduce errors, and provide a clear path for project evolution.

## Version Control System Used
For this project, I have chosen GitHub as my Version Control System. GitHub is renowned for its robustness, flexibility, and distributed nature, allowing for efficient handling of projects of any size. I chose GitHub because of its friendly interface, ease of use, and because it works best with my school's resources.

## Repository Setup
My repository is structured to provide easy access to my dev container, which can be used to run Flutter apps. It also contains a documents directory that includes all documentation related to the contents of the repository. This includes the source code and app dependencies for my Flutter Demo app in the FlutterDemoApp directory. Additionally, it contains a .github directory with workflows for running my pipeline in the "main.yml" file.

## Common Commands and Usage
During my development workflow, I frequently use commands such as:

`git commit -m` "type: description" for committing changes with a descriptive message.
`git pull`:  automates the process of fetching from a remote branch and then merging that into the local copy of that branch, helping to keep my local repository up-to-date  with the remote repository.

`git add`: for adding new files or directories to the local git staging area.
`git push`: to push those files in the staging area to my remote repository on Github.

## Collaboration Features

Pull Requests: Allowing team members to review proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge I faced with my version control  was ensuring that my version control was properly synced. Since when I started initally I commited changes directly from Github and also from Git, so the  environments were not fully in sync which caused issues with commiting changes.

## Conclusion
The use of Github will be extremely important for the success of this project. It has provided me with a robust framework for tracking changes, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring my development process is scalable and secure and organized. Integrating version control into my workflow will lead to more efficient development cycles and a stable codebase.
